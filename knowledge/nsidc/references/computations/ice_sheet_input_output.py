"""Sanctioned computation for the attested ice sheet mass balance by
the input-output method, in the ice sheet balance closure's shape.

Contract: nsidc/computations/ice-sheet-input-output.md. Over one
stated window, for one ice sheet and one named gate set, two terms in
gigatonnes per year and the mass rate they imply, a third estimate of
the same quantity the gravimetric and altimetric methods give:

  smb        the surface mass balance over the ice sheet's grounded
             domain (the data root's smb.csv), the product's own rate
             per time step, aggregated to the velocity epoch's
             calendar year by a period weighted mean, positive for
             mass gained at the surface;
  discharge  the flux of ice out through the gate set (the root's
             velocity.csv and thickness.csv): at each gate node, the
             ice density times the velocity component normal to the
             gate times the node width divided by the projection's
             areal scale at the node times the thickness at the node,
             summed over the nodes of every gate, positive for ice
             leaving.

The mass rate is smb minus discharge at each epoch, so a year the two
terms share cancels its common signal before the mean is taken. Each
rate over the window is the mean of its epochs, its interval takes
the effective sample size from the lag-1 autocorrelation of the
series, Student's t on the effective degrees of freedom, and the
larger of the sampling error and the formal error; the per-epoch
uncertainties are treated as fully correlated across epochs, because
the thickness error and the surface mass balance model error do not
resample from one year to the next, so the formal error of the mean
is the mean of them and not their quadrature. The bar on the mass
rate is its own half width plus the stated gate systematic, and the
verdict is whether the mass rate is distinguishable from zero.

Two input modes. --data-root DIR reads the term CSVs and RECORD.json
the loaders under references/loaders wrote (never a product file);
the committed root is references/retrieval/ice-sheet-input-output-root.
--fixture [--seed N] generates a synthetic root deterministically (a
hash-based Gaussian stream, stdlib only): a Greenland-like sheet with
a gate set that spans its margin and a planted discharge that rises
with time, a quarterly surface mass balance whose seasonal cycle
cancels over a year, a gate set whose thickness is an interpolation,
a gate set with a node on floating ice, and an Antarctic-like sheet
with both discharge factors and no grounded surface mass balance.

Refusals, exit 3 with a refusal receipt and never a number: a term
the root does not carry (term-not-in-root); a gate set the root does
not carry for the ice sheet (gate-set-not-in-root); a velocity epoch
family the root does not carry (velocity-epoch-not-in-root); a gate
set that does not span the ice sheet's grounded margin, so no sheet
wide rate can be formed from it (gate-set-incomplete); a gate node
whose thickness was not made by mass conservation
(gate-thickness-interpolated); a gate node the thickness product's
mask does not call grounded ice (gate-not-grounded); an ice sheet
whose grounded surface mass balance term is absent
(smb-term-missing); a window the velocity and surface mass balance
epochs do not cover (window-outside-epochs); a window shorter than
two years or with too few epochs in it (too-few-epochs); a rate whose
interval cannot be stated (interval-not-stated).

Consumers bind values for the declared parameters and MUST NOT edit
this file; the attester hashes it, regenerates the fixture at the
receipt's seed, and recomputes every node flux, every rate, every
interval, the mass rate, the bar and the verdict from the series in
the receipt.
