"""Loader for the firn term of the ice sheet mass balance closure: the
firn air content change from NASA's GEMB (Glacier Energy and Mass
Balance) model output as ITS_LIVE distributes it on AWS, aggregated
per ice sheet and per time step, written as the data root's firn.csv.

What ITS_LIVE distributes, and what this loader therefore reads:

  Greenland   height_change/Greenland/Greenland_G1920V01_IceSheetGlacierIceHeight.nc
              (the grounded ice sheet and peripheral glacier elevation
              change product, version 1.1, doi 10.5067/ICFVI7DKHZJV).
              Its variable dfac_gemb is the firn air content anomaly
              against 2014-01-01 from GEMB version 1.3.0, monthly from
              1992-01 to 2023-12 on the 1920 m EPSG:3413 grid, beside
              dfac_gsfc from GSFC-FDM version 1.2.1. Its mask separates
              the ice sheet (1) from the peripheral glaciers (2).
  Antarctica  height_change/Antarctica/Floating/ANT_G1920V01_IceShelfMelt.nc
              (the ice shelf height change and basal melt product,
              version 1.0, doi 10.5067/SE3XH9RXQWAM, NSIDC-0792). Its
              variable fac is the firn air content from GEMB r24739
              forced with 3-hourly ERA5 (the user guide), quarterly
              from 1992-03 to 2017-12 on the 1920 m EPSG:3031 grid,
              over the floating ice shelves only (ID 1 to 182; land is
              255). No GEMB field over grounded Antarctica is in the
              ITS_LIVE distribution, and the loader says so rather
              than substituting one.

What it computes, per domain and time step:

  1. The true ground area of every grid cell from the projection's
     areal scale (pyproj get_factors), so a polar stereographic cell
     counts by its area on the ellipsoid, not by its map area.
  2. A fixed cell set per domain: the cells inside the mask that carry
     a finite value at every time step, so an anomaly series is never
     moved by coverage changes.
  3. The area-weighted mean firn air content anomaly in metres of air
     over that set (value_m), the same anomaly integrated to a volume
     in km3 of air (volume_km3), the area and the cell count.
     Greenland: the product's own anomaly against 2014-01-01.
     Antarctica: fac minus the product's fac_mean (its 1992 to 2017
     record mean), so the reference is stated per domain in the stamp.
  4. The uncertainty. Greenland: the product ships no firn error, so
     the loader takes the absolute difference between the GEMB and the
     GSFC-FDM aggregates the file carries, a model-spread basis, not a
     formal error. Antarctica: the stated noise floor the altimetry
     and steric loaders use (the standard deviation of adjacent-step
     differences of the finished series over sqrt(2)), because the
     product's fac_err does not read as a firn air content error (tens
     of metres at the median, 9999 where it has none, a units
     attribute of m of ice per year); its statistics go in the stamp.
  5. The calendar month of each time value. A step with no finite
     value inside the mask (the ice shelf product's last quarter) is a
     non-sample, skipped and listed in the stamp, never filled. A
     second step falling in a month already taken is refused, never
     averaged. The Antarctic rows are quarterly (one row per product
     time step, labelled by the month of the time value) and say so in
     their sampling column.

Sign convention: positive is more air in the firn column, that is a
thicker firn column at unchanged mass.
