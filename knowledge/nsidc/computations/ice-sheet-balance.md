title: "Ice sheet mass balance closure from GRACE-FO mascons against altimetric volume change with a firn correction (attested)"
description: "Sanctioned closure of one ice sheet's mass balance over a stated window: the JPL mascon sum over the ice sheet's land mascons against the altimetric volume change less the GEMB firn air content change times a stated ice density, each as the mean of its annual-lag differences with an interval, the residual formed on the epochs both methods share, the bar its own half width plus the stated mascon selection systematic, a verdict closed_within_uncertainty, the GIA, low-degree, frame, smoothing, firn and density statements as receipt facts, and a refusal (exit 3, never a number) for a window outside the terms' overlap, an ice sheet without a firn term over its altimetry domain, or a window across the GRACE to GRACE-FO gap without continuity evidence. Proven on a synthetic fixture with a planted residual and anchored on a Greenland run over 2003 through 2016 from the stamped data root, read against the IMBIE 2023 assessment. The committed root's altimetry term is the ITS_LIVE elevation change; ICESat-2 ATL15 is the intended product, its loader built and awaiting a fetchable granule."

# Ice sheet mass balance closure from GRACE-FO mascons against altimetric volume change with a firn correction (attested)

The sanctioned computation behind any receipted statement that an
ice sheet's mass balance closes, or does not, between gravimetry and
altimetry over a window: the JPL mascon sum over the ice sheet's
mascons against the altimetric volume change converted to mass with
the GEMB firn air content change and a stated density, in the shape
of the podaac bundle's sea level budget closure.[^slb][^gotcha-firn]
It exists so that the conversion the ATL15 gotcha demands (a firn
model, a density, the GIA and elastic bookkeeping) is a set of receipt
facts an attester checks rather than a paragraph a reader trusts, and
so that the residual between the two observing systems is a stated
number with a stated bar. Version 1 is proven on a synthetic fixture
with a planted residual, and its real-data anchor is the stamped data
root committed beside it, run for Greenland over 2003 through 2016 in
the reference run below.[^data-root] The third estimate the
intercomparison literature uses, the input-output balance from a
surface mass balance and a discharge through flux gates, is not made
here; the boundaries section says why and names what would make it.

## Parameters

- `ice_sheet` (string, required): `greenland` or `antarctica`.
- `window` (string, required): an inclusive month range
  `YYYY-MM:YYYY-MM` of at least two years within the overlap of the
  terms (the committed root's Greenland overlap is 2002-04 through
  2023-12; the fixture's is 2003-01 through 2023-12 for the ITS_LIVE
  term and 2019-01 through 2023-10 for the ATL15 term).
- `altimetry` (string, optional, default `itslive`): the volume
  term's product, `itslive` (the ITS_LIVE elevation change, monthly)
  or `atl15` (ICESat-2 ATL15, quarterly); a root without the named
  term refuses.
- `ice_density` (number, optional, default 917): kilograms per cubic
  metre applied to the firn-corrected volume change; the default is
  the ice density the GEMB surface mass balance product itself uses,
  and a run may state another.
- `bridge` (string, optional): a citation of the independent
  continuity evidence across the GRACE to GRACE-FO gap; required for
  a window whose mass months lie on both sides of 2017-07 through
  2018-05.[^gotcha-gap]

## The terms and the bookkeeping

**Gravimetry.** The JPL RL06.3 version 4 CRI mascon grid summed over
the ice sheet's land mascons per solution month, in gigatonnes, with
the product's one-sigma-per-mascon uncertainty combined in quadrature
over the selected mascons.[^mascons] The Greenland set is the land
mascons whose land area is at least a quarter Greenland ice by the
ITS_LIVE Greenland mask binned onto the mascon grid with true cell
areas, 27 mascons of 2,122,549 square kilometres of land in the
committed root; the Antarctic set is every land mascon south of 60 S,
148 mascons, the CRI land mask counting the floating shelves as land.
A mascon that straddles Nares Strait or Denmark Strait cannot be
split by any rule, so the mass stamp lists every selected mascon with
its ice fraction, the four excluded land mascons that carry some
Greenland ice, and the full-series trend under two other thresholds
(minus 268.1 Gt per year at 5 percent, minus 244.3 at 50 percent,
against minus 252.0 at the rule's 25 percent); half that spread,
11.9 Gt per year, is the selection systematic the bar carries. The
stamp also records the comparison with the provider's own Greenland
series over the same 257 months (trends minus 252.0 and minus 255.8
Gt per year, a standard deviation of 29.0 Gt between the two after
the mean offset), read for the comparison only and never used to
adjust the sum.[^provider-series][^data-root] The GIA model
(ICE-6G_D, subtracted by the product), the low-degree series (C20 and
C30 from TN-14, degree 1 from JPL's mascon-consistent geocenter), the
reference frame and the mascon smoothing are stated in the mass stamp
as the product applied them, nothing re-applied, and travel in the
receipt's `bookkeeping.mass` block; the coastal leakage the CRI
filter reduces and does not remove is why the selection systematic is
stated beside the formal error.[^gotcha-gia][^gotcha-low-degree][^gotcha-leakage]

**Altimetry.** The volume anomaly of the surface height change summed
with true cell areas over the ice sheet's cells, less the firn air
content volume anomaly at the same epochs over the same domains,
times the stated ice density: one kilometre cubed is density over a
thousand gigatonnes.[^gotcha-firn][^gotcha-grid] The committed
root's volume term is the ITS_LIVE Greenland elevation change
(monthly, 1992 through 2023, the same file and the same fixed cell
sets of 464,999 ice sheet and 23,827 peripheral glacier cells as the
firn term) because the ATL15 Version 5 granules could not be fetched
from the drafting environment; the ATL15 loader is verified on its
selftest, the root's RECORD names the term absent with the reason,
and a run asking for it refuses.[^its-live][^atl15][^data-root] The
firn term is the earlier seed's root: the GEMB 1.3.0 firn air content
anomaly against 2014-01-01 with the GEMB to GSFC-FDM spread as its
uncertainty, a spread that crosses zero on 29 ice sheet rows, so each
row's uncertainty is floored at the series median of its domain
(0.109 m for the ice sheet, 0.072 m for the peripheral glaciers) and
the receipt says so in `bookkeeping.firn_floor`.[^data-root] Antarctica
has no grounded firn term in this root (the ITS_LIVE distribution
carries GEMB output over the floating shelves only), so the Antarctic
run refuses rather than states a volume as a mass; its mascon and
grounded volume terms are in the root for the day a grounded firn
loader lands.

**The rate method.** Each term's rate over the window is the mean of
its annual-lag differences (the value at an epoch less the value
twelve months earlier, so the seasonal cycle cancels exactly and a
monthly mascon hole removes only the differences it touches). Its
interval takes the effective sample size from the lag-1
autocorrelation of the differences, floored at the number of
non-overlapping years (differences a year apart share no epoch),
Student's t on the effective degrees of freedom, and the larger of
the sampling error and the formal error the per-epoch uncertainties
propagate; the receipt states which one the interval rests on. The
residual is the mean of altimetry minus gravimetry differences on the
epochs both terms carry, so the interannual signal both observing
systems see cancels before its scatter is measured, and the bar is
the residual's own half width plus the selection systematic. The
verdict `closed_within_uncertainty` is true when the residual lies
within that bar. A residual that fails to close is read as a
correction-consistency finding before a missing-physics one: the firn
model and its forcing, the density, the mascon selection and the
altimetry record's mission transitions are the first things a reader
audits, in the bookkeeping block.[^gotcha-firn][^slb]

## The fixture and its known truth

`--fixture --seed N` generates the root deterministically from a
hash-based Gaussian stream (no numeric library in the path): a
Greenland-like sheet losing 250 Gt per year with a 120 Gt annual
cycle peaking in April, an AR(1) interannual component and monthly
mascon noise of 20 to 30 Gt, the mascon months the real record lacks
removed (the gap and the battery-management months the sea level
budget fixture lists); a firn air volume losing 6 cubic kilometres
per year with a 45 cubic kilometre cycle and a stated uncertainty
drawn from |N(0.08, 0.06)| metres so that it crosses zero and the
floor rule is exercised; a monthly ITS_LIVE-shaped volume from 1992
and a quarterly ATL15-shaped one from 2019, each the ice volume plus
the firn air plus noise, with the altimetric rate exceeding the
gravimetric one by a planted +5 Gt per year; and an Antarctic-like
sheet with mass and volume but no grounded firn term. The receipt
records the seed, the fixture digest and the generator's digest (the
executor itself), and the attester regenerates the fixture and
compares every series value.

## The refusal rule

A run writes a refusal receipt (`refused: true`, a `reason_code` and
the reason in words) and exits 3, never a number, when the window
lies outside the overlap of the terms it needs
(`window-outside-overlap`); when the window is shorter than two years
or a term has too few epochs in it, or too few annual-lag differences
are common to both terms (`too-few-epochs`); when the firn term does
not cover the altimetry domain (`firn-term-missing`, the Antarctic
case on this root); when the root does not carry the altimetry
product named (`term-not-in-root`); when the mass months lie on both
sides of the inter-mission gap with no bridge (`gap-without-bridge`);
or when a rate's interval cannot be stated (`interval-not-stated`).
The attester attests a refusal PASS only as a refusal, reproduced
by re-running the executor's own assembly and compute on the
regenerated fixture, or on the tree when `--data-root` names it;
without the tree, a data-root refusal is reproduced from the spans
and domains the receipt records where it can be
(`window-outside-overlap`, `firn-term-missing`, `term-not-in-root`,
`gap-without-bridge`) and taken on the executor's word otherwise.
The verdict line reads `PASS refusal`.

## The attester criterion (deterministic, consumer-side)

A run PASSES only when all hold, one `PASS name` or `FAIL name:
reason` line per check: every declared field present; the code hash
is the sanctioned file; the `bundle` block names this bundle's
package, version and release lock digest and the `capability` block
is well formed; a runtime is named; the fixture regenerated at the
receipt's seed hashes to the receipt's digest (for a data root, the
RECORD stamp, its digest and the term file digests are present, and
with `--data-root DIR` each matches the tree and the tree's own
RECORD manifest, and the recorded root is that tree
package-relative; the executor itself refuses a term file whose
digest is not the manifest's); the four series are well formed, the
altimetric mass is the density times the volume less the firn air at
every epoch, the firn uncertainties are floored, the residual series
is the difference of the two terms' annual-lag differences on their
common epochs, and every value is what the regenerated fixture
yields, or with `--data-root` what the tree's term files rebuild
through the executor's own assembly; every rate block, the residual
block, the selection systematic, the bar and the verdict recompute
from the series by a second implementation of the method
statement; the bookkeeping
carries every required statement, the density and firn floor blocks
agree with the bound parameters and the series, and the gap handling
agrees with the mass months; and on the fixture the known truth
holds (the verdict says closed, each rate within 15 and 20 Gt per
year of the imposed ones, the residual within the larger of 5 Gt per
year and the bar of the planted one), while on a data root each rate
lies inside stated plausibility bounds. The verdict is scatter-forgiving by
construction: the bar is the residual's own half width, so it grows
with the disagreement it measures (2003 through 2016 closes at a bar
of 141 while 2010 through 2016 fails at 94), and a closed verdict
over a long window says the two records agree in the mean, not that
they agree year by year. The selftest covers two fixture passes,
eleven tampers each failing on its check, a wrong release, a
tampered computation, all six refusals and a forged one, a bridged
run across the gap and the same receipt with its bridge stripped, and
the data-root path on the fixture written as a root: attested against
the tree, refused by the executor when a term file drifts from the
manifest, failed against another tree when the manifest is rewritten,
and failed on its series when they are tampered.

## The data root, for a real run

The run instructions that sat under references/skills/ are retired: a procedure is a skill, and a skill lives in the capability whose sphere this concept names (the placement rule, ADR C in the marketplace repository). That capability, land-ice, is planned and not yet a package, so this computation is unwrapped for now: the executor's usage text (`--help`) states the fixture run, the refusal rule and the receipt path, the attester's usage text states how a receipt is attested, and this section keeps the one part of the retired instructions that is contract and not procedure, the layout of the data root the executor reads. The executor's own usage text still names the retired file for that layout; it is revised, with a fresh reference run, when the wrapping skill lands.

The real run's tree is committed at
references/retrieval/ice-sheet-balance-root, built by the loaders
under references/loaders (isb_firn_gemb.py and isb_smb_gemb.py for the
GEMB terms, isb_mass_mascons.py for the mascon grid,
isb_volume_itslive.py for the ITS_LIVE elevation change,
isb_volume_atl15.py for ATL15 when its granules can be fetched, each
with `--selftest`) and stamped by isb_data_root.py, which writes
RECORD.json with the bookkeeping and closure tables from the loaders'
stamps; SOURCES.json records the downloads and the granules that could
not be fetched. This is the layout the computation reads.
`--data-root DIR` in place of `--fixture`:

```
DIR/
  RECORD.json           the stamp: record name, manifest_sha256, verified_utc,
                        terms_present, terms_absent, the loaders' stamps and the
                        bookkeeping table with its closure section
  mass.csv              ice_sheet, domain (land_mascons), month, value_gt,
                        uncertainty_gt, ...   one row per ice sheet and solution month
  firn.csv              ice_sheet, domain, month, value_m, uncertainty_m, volume_km3,
                        area_km2, ...          the firn root of the earlier seed
  volume-itslive.csv    ice_sheet, domain, month, value_km3, uncertainty_km3,
                        uncertainty_correlated_km3, area_km2, ..., sampling, product
  volume-atl15.csv      the same columns from ATL15, quarterly; absent from the
                        committed root, and RECORD.json says why
  smb.csv               the surface mass balance term (ice shelves only; not read
                        by this computation)
  <term>-stamp.json     one stamp per term file
  SOURCES.json          the downloads, with URL, hash and time
```

Months are `YYYY-MM`, unique per ice sheet and domain; a quarterly row
is one product epoch labelled by its month. The executor reads only
these files, never a product file, refuses a term file whose digest
is not the RECORD manifest's, and copies the RECORD summary, its
digest and the term file digests into the receipt; the data root is
recorded package-relative so the run id is the same on any machine.
`RECORD.json` must carry, under `bookkeeping`, the mass term's `gia`,
`low_degree`, `reference_frame`, `effective_smoothing`, `selection`
and `uncertainty_basis`, the volume term's `reference`, `mask`,
`uncertainty_basis` and `not_mass`, the firn term's `reference`,
`uncertainty_basis`, `gemb_version` and `forcing`, and a `closure`
table for both ice sheets; the attester refuses a receipt missing any
of them.

Which loader produces each file:

- `mass.csv`: the CRI-filtered mascon grid summed over the ice sheet's
  land mascons per solution month, in gigatonnes, with the per-mascon
  formal error in quadrature; the Greenland set is the land mascons
  whose land is at least a quarter Greenland ice by the ITS_LIVE mask,
  the Antarctic set every land mascon south of 60 S, and the stamp
  records the selection's sensitivity and the comparison with the
  provider's own series ([the mascon concept in the podaac bundle](../../podaac/datasets/grace-fo-mascons.md)).
- `firn.csv` and `smb.csv`: the GEMB firn air content and surface
  mass balance terms of the earlier seed, unchanged in value.
- `volume-itslive.csv`: the ITS_LIVE surface elevation change summed
  to a volume anomaly over the same cell sets as the firn term
  (Greenland) and over the grounded Antarctic product's cells from
  2003 on ([the velocity and elevation change products](../datasets/its-live-ice-velocity.md)
  are the same project's).
- `volume-atl15.csv`: the ATL15 10 km delta_h summed with ice_area
  ([the ATL15 concept](../datasets/icesat2-atl15.md)); the loader
  needs an Earthdata Login and a route to the NSIDC cloud archive.

## Reference run

**Fixture run (seed 7, Greenland, 2019-01 through 2022-12, the ATL15
term, measured 2026-09-15).** 48 mascon months and 16 quarterly
altimetry epochs; 12 annual-lag differences common to both.
Gravimetry minus 252.790 Gt per year, 95 percent interval [minus
274.535, minus 231.044] on the sampling error; altimetry minus
245.189, [minus 386.044, minus 104.335] on the formal error, which
the floored firn spread dominates; residual +15.729 against a bar of
142.670 (the residual's half width, the selection systematic being
zero on a synthetic root); `closed_within_uncertainty` true, the
planted +5 recovered within the bar. **Fixture run (seed 7,
Greenland, 2003-01 through 2016-12, the ITS_LIVE term).** 152 mascon
months and 168 altimetry epochs, 128 common differences; gravimetry
minus 250.649, [minus 261.184, minus 240.113]; altimetry minus
243.821, [minus 285.038, minus 202.603]; residual +7.999 against a
bar of 44.971; closed. The imposed truth is gravimetry minus 250 and
a residual of +5. The refusal case the gate exercises is the ATL15
window 2019-01 through 2025-12 (outside the fixture's firn term,
exit 3, attested as a refusal); the Antarctic refusal
(`firn-term-missing`) is exercised on the committed root. The
registry entries `ice-sheet-balance` and `ice-sheet-balance-long`
in tools/reference_runs.yaml, each naming this bundle, are the two
fixture runs.

**Real-data run (the stamped data root
ice-sheet-balance-root-2026-09-15, Greenland, 2003-01 through
2016-12, the ITS_LIVE term, run sha256:d9f24a2b51b08a22 under the
runtime claude-code, measured 2026-09-15).** 151 of 168 mascon months (the 17 missing are June
2003 and the battery-management months the product's list names),
168 altimetry epochs, 127 common differences. Gravimetry minus
281.297 Gt per year, 95 percent interval [minus 328.727, minus
233.867] on the sampling error (the year-to-year variability of the
rate; the formal error at 95 percent is 3.99); altimetry minus
283.353, [minus 387.747, minus 178.959] on the sampling error (formal
44.83, the floored firn spread); a volume rate of minus 364.4 cubic
kilometres per year of which minus 55.4 is firn air. On the 127
common epochs the altimetry mean is minus 306.421 and the gravimetry
mean minus 281.297, so the residual is minus 25.123 Gt per year
against a bar of 140.813 (the residual's half width 128.879, its
sampling error 58.5 on 12.0 effective years, plus the selection
systematic 11.934); `closed_within_uncertainty` true. The two rates
agree in the mean to 2 Gt per year on their own epochs, but the
residual series scatters by 203 Gt per year from month to month: the
two records disagree at the annual scale by hundreds of gigatonnes
per year, and the receipt's series say which term carries each
spike. At 2010-01 the annual-lag volume difference is minus 994
cubic kilometres per year while the firn air difference is minus 78
(the sheet-wide volume anomaly falls 400 cubic kilometres between
2009-06 and 2010-01 while the firn air anomaly falls 82), so the
altimetric loss reads minus 840 Gt per year against the mascons'
minus 309: that interval, from the end of ICESat in October 2009 to
the start of CryoSat-2 in July 2010, is where the ITS_LIVE record
rests on Envisat alone, so the 2010 spike belongs to the volume term
and its mission transition, which the volume stamp cannot confirm
because the product records no per-epoch mission composition. At
2013-01 the volume difference is minus 494 and the firn air
difference minus 297 (between 2012-06 and 2012-09 the volume drops
468 cubic kilometres and the firn air anomaly 479, GEMB's response to
the July 2012 melt), so the firn correction cancels most of the
surface lowering and the altimetric loss reads minus 180 against the
mascons' minus 516: the 2013 spike belongs to the firn term. Mascon
leakage is the least likely carrier, the mascon term's annual-lag
scatter being 112 Gt per year and the provider's series matching it
to 29 Gt. Against the IMBIE
2023 assessment, whose Table 2 gives Greenland minus 180 with an
uncertainty of 39 Gt per year for 2002 to 2006, minus 280 with 38 for
2007 to 2011 and minus 213 with 40 for 2012 to 2016 (an average near
minus 228 over 2003 to 2016) and whose 2003 to 2018 overlap gives a
reconciled minus 221 with an uncertainty of 22 with the three
techniques within a standard deviation of 19 Gt per year of each
other, both rates here sit about 55 Gt per year more negative,
outside the assessment's uncertainty and inside the interval each
rate carries; the provider's own Greenland series (header trend minus
259.8 with 21.0 one sigma over 2002 to 2026; minus 255.8 by the same
least squares over the same 257 months) is 4 Gt per year more
negative than the mass stamp's sum, and over 2003 through 2016 its
annual-lag mean is minus 285.4 against this sum's minus 281.3, so the
offset from the assessment is a property of the mascon product and
the selection rule, not of this
sum.[^otosaka-2023][^provider-series][^data-root] The
registry entry `ice-sheet-balance-record` reruns it, and the check
chain the pull request names verifies the stamp, reruns the executor
on the data root and attests the receipt against the tree on every
change.

**Pass bar.** There is no measured tolerance to record: the verdict
is a comparison of the residual against the bar the receipt itself
carries, and the attester recomputes both. The plausibility bands on
the fixture (15 and 20 Gt per year around the imposed rates, the
larger of 5 Gt per year and the bar around the planted residual) are
sanity bounds on the chain, not a science tolerance.

## Boundaries

One real-data run is the anchor, Greenland over 2003 through 2016, a
window that does not cross the inter-mission gap; a run across the
gap needs a bridge citation and has not been made. The anchor's
closure is a cancellation of two halves of opposite sign: 2003
through 2009 gives a residual of minus 82 against a bar of 201
(closed) and 2010 through 2016 gives +109 against 94 (not closed,
gravimetry minus 324 against altimetry minus 203). The windows after
2019 on this root do not close either: 2019 through 2022 gives +136
against 117, 2019 through 2023 gives +157 against 103 with gravimetry
minus 223 against altimetry minus 66 (a volume rate of minus 148
cubic kilometres per year of which minus 76 is firn air), and 2020
through 2023 gives +139 against 138. The provider's mascon series
tracks the loader's sum in every window (minus 329 against minus 324
over 2010 through 2016, minus 228 against minus 223 over 2019 through
2023), so the term that drifts is the ITS_LIVE elevation change with
its GEMB firn correction, whose altimetric rate after 2019 is far
from every published Greenland rate; the closure verdict is window
dependent, and the altimetry term is the suspect. Antarctica refuses on this
root for want of a grounded firn air content term: the ITS_LIVE
distribution carries GEMB output over the floating shelves only, and
the RACMO2 and MAR alternates the firn stamp names were not read; a
loader for one of them on the grounded sheet would make the Antarctic
run without any change to the executor.[^data-root] The
input-output balance is not made: the root holds no Greenland surface
mass balance and no grounded Antarctic one, and no discharge, which
would take the ITS_LIVE velocity mosaics across flux gates on
grounded ice upstream of the grounding line with BedMachine
thickness, where the thickness between flight lines is mass
conservation or an interpolation with errbed saying which and the
Antarctic guide's mass-conservation threshold is 30 metres per
year;[^its-live][^bedmachine][^gotcha-gate][^gotcha-thickness] the
published input-output estimates the reader compares against are
IMBIE's input-output group, which in Greenland agrees with altimetry
and gravimetry over 2003 to 2018 within the 19 Gt per year spread
quoted above.[^otosaka-2023] The altimetry term is the ITS_LIVE
elevation change and not ATL15, for the reason the data root
records; an ATL15 run on this executor awaits a fetchable granule.
The Greenland altimetry domain is the ITS_LIVE mask (the ice sheet
and the peripheral glaciers) and the gravimetry domain is a set of
whole mascons that also hold ice-free land, coastal ocean and, at
the rule's threshold, a share of the Canadian Arctic and Iceland
signal; the residual carries that mismatch, and the selection
systematic is its stated size.[^gotcha-basins][^gotcha-leakage] The
firn uncertainty is a two-model spread, floored, not a formal error;
the density is one number for the whole sheet; no elastic or GIA
correction is applied to the altimetry, and the mascon product's GIA
model is stated, not varied. The intervals on the term rates are
dominated by the year-to-year variability of the rate itself (the
sampling error) and are not measurement uncertainties in the
assessment's sense; the formal error stands beside each. Produced by
Open Science Pillars, not a NASA, JPL or NSIDC product.

**Verification.** The bundle-path sources are this bundle's and the
podaac bundle's own concepts; the data root and its stamp are
committed in this repository and the real-data run was made and
attested on 2026-09-15 from them.[^data-root][^loaders] The mascon
granule, the provider's two mass series and the three ITS_LIVE files
were read on 2026-09-15 and their hashes are in SOURCES.json, as are
the ATL15 access attempts with their status codes; Otosaka and others
2023 was read in full on 2026-09-15 through its Crossref record's
link after the DOI resolved, and its record (title, authors, journal,
volume, pages, year) was verified against the Crossref registry the
same day, as was Smith and others 2020, whose text the ATL15 gotcha
read on 2026-09-13 and which is cited here on its registry
record.[^otosaka-2023][^smith-2020] The chain is verified on every
change by the repository's check routine once the coordinator adds
the lines the pull request names: the attester's selftest, the
fixture run and its refusal, the loaders' selftests, the data root
check and the record run attested against the tree.
