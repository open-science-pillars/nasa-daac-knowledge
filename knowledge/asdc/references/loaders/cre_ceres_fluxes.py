"""Loader for the flux terms of the attested cloud radiative effect at
the top of the atmosphere: the all-sky and clear-sky shortwave,
longwave and net fluxes of CERES EBAF Edition 4.2.1, area weighted
over each region the computation can resolve and under each clear-sky
convention the product carries, written as the data root's
cre-fluxes.csv.

What it computes, per calendar month of the product file, per region
and per clear-sky convention:

  1. The area weighted regional mean of six fields, three all-sky
     (toa_sw_all_mon, toa_lw_all_mon, toa_net_all_mon) and three
     clear-sky (the _clr_t_ triple for the total-region convention,
     the _clr_c_ triple for the cloud-free-area one). The weights are
     the CERES one degree zonal geodetic weights, the weights the
     product's own global means are formed with: an oblate spheroid
     with the equatorial radius 6378.137 km and the polar radius
     6356.752 km, the solar division factor 4.0034 rather than 4. A
     region is a band of whole one degree zones, so its mean is the
     same weighted mean restricted to those zones, which is what
     "weighted the way the product's own global mean is defined"
     means here. The loader checks itself: the weights applied to the
     global band reproduce the product's own gtoa_ global means, and
     the difference is written in the stamp.
  2. The calendar month of each time value (days since 2000-03-01,
     the mid-month day) as the row label. A month whose fields carry
     no value in a region is not a sample and is skipped; the stamp
     lists it.
  3. A per-month uncertainty floor for each of the three cloud
     radiative effect terms, per region and convention: the standard
     deviation of adjacent-month differences of that term's series
     with its calendar-month means removed, divided by sqrt(2). The
     product ships no uncertainty field, so the floor is measured on
     the series and named in the stamp; the published regional monthly
     clear-sky flux uncertainties are written beside it for
     comparison, never mixed into it.

The shortwave and longwave fields are outgoing fluxes and the net
field is downward minus upward, so the cloud radiative effect the
computation forms from these columns is clear-sky minus all-sky in
the shortwave and the longwave and all-sky minus clear-sky in the
net, which is the product's own arithmetic; the loader checks its
total-region global columns against the product's own gtoa_cre_
variables and writes that difference in the stamp too.

Which clear-sky field a convention names is the bundle's convention
concept, conventions/ceres-clear-sky-conventions.md; the loader binds
the two the energy balanced product carries and refuses to invent a
third.

The product file is read from a local path. With --fetch the file is
downloaded first when the path does not exist, from the ASDC OPeNDAP
service as a netCDF-4 subset carrying only the variables read, or
from any URL given with --url; the download is tried without
credentials, then once more with the Earthdata Login bearer token in
EARTHDATA_TOKEN sent as a request header, which is never written
anywhere. The zonal geodetic weights are read from --weights, and
with --fetch downloaded from the CERES general product information
page's weights file when that path does not exist. A download record
(URL, status, bytes, sha256, time) is written beside each file, and
the stamp copies it under sources. The product file stays where it
was downloaded, outside the data root; only the CSV and the stamp are
committed.

Usage:
  cre_ceres_fluxes.py --product FILE.nc --weights zone_weights.txt
      --out cre-fluxes.csv [--stamp-out cre-fluxes-stamp.json]
      [--start YYYY-MM] [--end YYYY-MM] [--fetch [--url URL]
      [--weights-url URL]]
  --selftest   a synthetic grid with known regional means
