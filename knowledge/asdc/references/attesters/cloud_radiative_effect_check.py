"""Deterministic attester for the attested cloud radiative effect at the
top of the atmosphere (cloud_radiative_effect.py). Stdlib only,
consumer side, no language model.

A receipt from any runtime attests PASS (exit 0) only when ALL hold,
else FAIL (exit 1) naming the check; one line per check, `PASS name`
or `FAIL name: reason`:

  fields       every declared receipt field is present;
  code         the receipt's code_sha256 is the sanctioned executor
               beside this file (or the one --computation names), so an
               edited computation invalidates every earlier receipt;
  release      the receipt's bundle block names this tree's package
               name, version and release lock digest, and its capability
               block is well formed;
  runtime      the receipt names the runtime that produced it;
  data         a fixture regenerated here at the receipt's seed hashes
               to the receipt's digest, and the generator (the executor
               itself) to the receipt's generator digest; for a data
               root, the record name, the record's digest, the files
               read and the stamp are present, and with --data-root DIR
               the record, the CSV and the stamp in that tree hash to
               the receipt's digests (without the tree the check says
               the digests were not verified);
  convention   the bound clear-sky convention is one the product
               carries, the receipt's convention bookkeeping is the
               sanctioned block for it, and the contrast block names
               the other convention;
  region       the bound region is one the computation resolves and the
               receipt's region bookkeeping carries its sanctioned
               latitude band;
  series       the months used and missing partition the window, the
               three cloud radiative effect series are the stated
               differences of the six flux columns (clear-sky minus
               all-sky in the outgoing shortwave and longwave,
               all-sky minus clear-sky in the net), and on a fixture
               the flux columns are what the regenerated fixture
               yields (1e-9);
  recompute    the three window means with their half widths and formal
               errors, the term uncertainties, the residual, the
               combined uncertainty, the verdict, the other
               convention's three terms and the distance from the
               published global mean recompute here from the receipt
               (1e-9 relative): an independent recompute of the method
               statement, with its own Student's t from the density;
  bookkeeping  every required statement is present, the published
               anchor block is the sanctioned one, the decomposition
               tolerance is the sanctioned one, the window handling
               lists exactly the months missing, and the sign
               convention is stated;
  plausible    stated bounds: the shortwave term between -120 and 0
               W m-2, the longwave between -10 and 60, the net between
               -80 and 20, the per-month uncertainties positive and
               below 20; and on the fixture the known truth: each
               recovered term within 1.5 W m-2 of the planted one, the
               recovered convention contrast within 0.3 of the planted
               one, and the known_truth block agreeing with the
               recompute.

A refusal receipt (refused true) attests PASS only as a refusal: the
identity checks hold, the reason code is one the executor issues, and
the refusal is reproduced here from the bound parameters and the
regenerated fixture, or from the tree --data-root names. A data-root
refusal that needs the record to reproduce and is given no tree is
taken on the executor's word and FAILS; a refusal that the bound
parameters alone settle (an unknown convention or an unresolvable
region) is reproduced either way. The verdict line of a reproduced
refusal reads `PASS refusal`, and the exit is 0.

--out writes the attestation: the verdict, whether it is a refusal, the
attester's and the computation's digests, the receipt's digest and run
id, the capability, bundle and runtime blocks copied from the receipt,
and every check.
