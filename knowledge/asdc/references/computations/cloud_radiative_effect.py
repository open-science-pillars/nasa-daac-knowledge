"""Sanctioned computation for the attested cloud radiative effect at the
top of the atmosphere: the shortwave, longwave and net effect of
clouds on the CERES EBAF radiation budget over one stated window and
one stated region, as the difference between the all-sky and the
clear-sky fluxes of the energy balanced product.

Contract: asdc/computations/cloud-radiative-effect.md. Over one window
of calendar months and one region, the receipt carries three terms in
watts per square metre of the region, each with an uncertainty and the
stamp it came from:

  cre_shortwave  the window mean of the regional mean clear-sky minus
                 all-sky outgoing shortwave flux, negative where
                 clouds reflect more sunlight than the clear column;
  cre_longwave   the window mean of the regional mean clear-sky minus
                 all-sky outgoing longwave flux, positive where clouds
                 reduce the flux to space;
  cre_net        the window mean of the regional mean all-sky minus
                 clear-sky net downward flux, read from the product's
                 net fields and not from the two above.

The residual is cre_net minus the sum of the shortwave and longwave
terms: the decomposition of the net cloud radiative effect into its
two parts is an identity of the product's own fields, and the residual
measures whether the fields keep it. The combined uncertainty is the
three term uncertainties in quadrature; the verdict
decomposition_closes says whether the residual lies inside a stated
tolerance, which is the granularity of the fields and not the sampling
bar.

The clear-sky convention is a declared parameter, because the product
carries more than one quantity called clear-sky and a cloud radiative
effect inherits the convention of the field it subtracts. The energy
balanced product carries two: `total-region`, the clear-sky flux for
the whole region with its cloudy portions included, which is the
definition climate models use and the one the product's own cloud
radiative effect variables are computed from since Edition 4.1; and
`cloud-free-area`, the traditional flux over the cloud-free portions
of a region, filled where no cloud-free footprint was observed, which
is what Edition 4.0 provided. The bundle's convention concept
conventions/ceres-clear-sky-conventions.md states the four quantities
the radiation products call clear-sky and which convention each field
carries; the two this computation binds are the two the energy
balanced product's variables carry, and a convention it does not carry
is refused rather than approximated. The receipt also carries the
other convention's three terms over the same window and region and the
difference between them, so the price of the choice is a receipt fact
rather than a paragraph.

The fields are area weighted with the CERES one degree zonal geodetic
weights, the weights the product's own global means are formed with,
so a regional mean here is the product's own global mean restricted to
the region's zones. A region is a band of whole one degree zones; a
land or ocean region is not resolvable from the fields read and is
refused.

Two input modes. --data-root DIR reads cre-fluxes.csv (region,
convention, month, the three all-sky and the three clear-sky regional
means, and the three per-month uncertainty floors), the loader's
stamp, and the RECORD.json the data-root tool wrote, every file
checked against its manifest. --fixture [--seed N] generates a
synthetic record deterministically (a hash-based Gaussian stream): for
every region and both conventions a monthly all-sky and clear-sky flux
2000-03 through 2026-05 with a planted cloud radiative effect, an
annual cycle, an interannual AR(1) component, noise at the stated
per-month uncertainty, and a planted convention offset, with the net
columns formed from the shortwave and longwave ones so that the
decomposition holds by construction; the receipt shows the planted
effect and the planted offset recovered.

Refusals, exit 3 with a refusal receipt and never a number: a
clear-sky convention the product does not carry
(clear-sky-convention-not-carried); a window outside the record
(window-outside-record); a region whose mask cannot be resolved
(region-not-resolvable); fewer than 24 months in the window
(too-few-months); a window mean whose half width cannot be stated
(interval-not-stated).

The receipt's run_id digests the receipt without its timestamp; the
data root is recorded package-relative when it sits under this
package, so a record run reproduces its id on any machine. Consumers
bind values for the declared parameters and MUST NOT edit this file;
the attester hashes it, regenerates the fixture at the receipt's seed,
and recomputes every number from the receipt.
