"""Sanctioned computation for the attested energy budget closure: the
CERES EBAF net top-of-atmosphere flux against the Argo ocean heat
content change over one stated window.

Contract: asdc/computations/energy-budget.md. Over one window of
calendar months, the receipt carries four rate terms in watts per
square metre of the Earth's surface, each with an uncertainty and the
stamp it came from:

  toa_net       the window mean of the EBAF global mean net TOA flux
                (all-sky, positive downward) as the product's own
                geodetically weighted global mean carries it, since the
                product's anchor is defined on that mean; the
                uncertainty is the anchor's in situ uncertainty (0.10
                W m-2, 95 percent) in quadrature with the larger of
                the sampling half width of the window mean under a
                lag-1 autocorrelated residual and the formal error the
                per-month floor propagates;
  ohc_0_2000    the 0 to 2000 dbar ocean heat content rate over the
                same window, read from the ocean-science Argo
                computation's receipt (terms.trend, ZJ per year with
                its uncertainty) and converted with the Earth's surface
                area; the receipt's own per-area rate must agree;
  deep_ocean    the ocean below 2000 m, which the Argo receipt states
                as an omission: the published rate, with its source,
                as a term here;
  non_ocean     land, cryosphere and atmosphere, published rates with
                their sources.

The residual is toa_net minus the sum of the three ocean-side terms;
the combined uncertainty is the four in quadrature; the verdict
closed_within_uncertainty says whether the radiation and the heat
inventory agree over the window. The same four terms are also stated
as energy over the window in zettajoules (rate times the window length
times the Earth's area), beside the Argo receipt's own fitted and
endpoint changes.

The anchoring caveat (the bundle's gotcha): the EBAF global mean net
flux was set once to an in situ heat uptake over July 2005 through
June 2015, so the toa_net term is not independent of ocean heating
over the months the window shares with that decade; the receipt
counts those months. What the ocean data did not set is the
variation, so the receipt also carries the EBAF net flux anomaly
against the window's own mean, formed from the cos-latitude weighted
global mean of the one degree grid, with its linear trend over the
window (W m-2 per decade, a 95 percent interval under the AR(1)
residual model) and the distance of that trend from the published
satellite and in situ trend of the Earth's energy imbalance; the
anchor cancels in the anomaly and in its trend.

Two input modes. --data-root DIR reads toa-net.csv (month, value_W_m2
the cos-latitude mean, uncertainty_W_m2, product_global_W_m2 the
product's geodetic mean), the loader's stamp, the RECORD.json the
data-root tool wrote (every file checked against its manifest), and
the Argo receipt (--ohc-receipt PATH, default DIR/ohc-2000-receipt.json).
--fixture [--seed N] generates a synthetic record deterministically (a
hash-based Gaussian stream): a monthly net flux 2000-03 through
2026-05 with a planted level and a planted trend, an annual cycle, an
interannual AR(1) component and noise at the stated per-month
uncertainty, a planted geodetic offset, and a planted ocean-side
receipt whose rate closes the budget by construction, so the receipt
shows the planted level, trend and closure recovered.

Refusals, exit 3 with a refusal receipt and never a number: a window
outside the radiation record (window-outside-record); an Argo receipt
whose window is not the window asked for (ohc-window-mismatch), since
its rate is a whole-window quantity; an Argo receipt that is itself a
refusal (ohc-receipt-refused); fewer than 24 months in the window
(too-few-months); a trend whose interval cannot be stated
(interval-not-stated).

The receipt's run_id digests the receipt without its timestamp; the
data root and the receipt path are recorded package-relative when they
sit under this package, so a record run reproduces its id on any
machine. Consumers bind values for the declared parameters and MUST
NOT edit this file; the attester hashes it, regenerates the fixture at
the receipt's seed, and recomputes every number from the receipt.
