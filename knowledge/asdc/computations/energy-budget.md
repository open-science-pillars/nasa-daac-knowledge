# Energy budget closure from CERES EBAF and Argo (attested)

The sanctioned computation behind any receipted statement that the
Earth's radiation imbalance measured from the top of the atmosphere
and the heat found in the Earth system agree, or do not, over a
window: the EBAF global mean net TOA flux against the 0 to 2000 dbar
ocean heat content rate the ocean-science Argo computation states in
its receipt, plus the deep ocean and the non-ocean components as
published rates with their sources.[^dataset][^ohc-receipt][^vs-2023]
It exists in this bundle so that the anchoring caveat the bundle's
high-severity gotcha states is a set of receipt facts an attester
checks rather than a paragraph a reader trusts: the receipt counts the
months the window shares with the anchor decade, states the absolute
term as anchored, and carries beside it the anomaly comparison in
which the anchor cancels.[^gotcha-anchor] Version 1 is proven on a
synthetic fixture with a planted level, trend and closure, and its
real-data anchor is the stamped data root committed beside it, run
for 2006 through 2020 in the reference run below.[^data-root] A
fixture receipt says in its caveats that it proves the chain, not the
Earth.

## Parameters

- `window` (string, required): an inclusive month range
  `YYYY-MM:YYYY-MM` within the radiation record (the fixture spans
  2000-03 through 2026-05; a data root spans what its stamp holds,
  the same months for the committed root). The Argo receipt's window
  must be this window: its rate is a whole-window quantity, and a
  receipt over any other window is refused.

## The terms and the bookkeeping

Every term is a rate in watts per square metre of the Earth's surface
(4 pi R squared with the 6371 km mean radius, the Argo receipt's and
the published inventories' convention), with an uncertainty at the 95
percent level and the stamp it came from:[^vs-2023][^ohc-receipt]

- **toa_net**: the window mean of the product's own global mean net
  TOA flux, all-sky, positive downward, as the loader wrote it from
  gtoa_net_all_mon. The product forms that mean with zonal geodetic
  weights (an oblate spheroid, the solar division factor 4.0034), and
  the anchor of 0.71 W m-2 is defined on it, which is why the absolute
  term is taken from it and not from the cos-latitude mean of the one
  degree grid: the cos-latitude mean sits 0.22 W m-2 above the
  geodetic mean over the record (0.15 to 0.28 across the annual
  cycle), because the net flux has a strong meridional gradient, and
  the loader writes both columns and the offset between
  them.[^dqs][^geodetic-weights][^opendap-subset] The uncertainty is
  the anchor's in situ uncertainty, 0.10 W m-2, in quadrature with the
  larger of the sampling half width of the window mean (the residual
  about the calendar-month means under a lag-1 autocorrelated model,
  Student's t on the effective degrees of freedom) and the formal
  error the per-month floor propagates.[^gotcha-anchor][^johnson-2016]
- **ohc_0_2000**: the Argo receipt's trend term (ZJ per year with the
  uncertainty the receipt states, the larger of its sampling half
  width and its formal error) converted with the Earth's area; the
  receipt's own rate per unit Earth surface must agree to one part in
  a million or the executor stops. The rate is over the Roemmich and
  Gilson product's mapped open-ocean domain (64.5S to 65.5N, the
  columns mapped at every level) and is never scaled to the global
  ocean, so it understates the global ocean by
  construction.[^ohc-receipt]
- **deep_ocean**: the ocean below 2000 m, which the Argo receipt
  states as an omission with a published rate: 0.06 plus or minus
  0.03 W m-2 (0.97 plus or minus 0.48 ZJ per year) over 1992 to 2020
  as a constant linear trend from repeat hydrography, a term of its
  own here; the receipt's statement must agree with the sanctioned
  one, and the agreement is a receipt
  fact.[^vs-2023][^purkey-johnson-2010]
- **non_ocean**: land, cryosphere and atmosphere over 2006 to 2020
  from the Earth heat inventory: land 0.038 plus or minus 0.013 and
  cryosphere 0.030 plus or minus 0.011 W m-2 as about 5 and about 4
  percent of the 0.76 plus or minus 0.2 W m-2 imbalance the inventory
  states for that era (the uncertainty is the percentage point each
  fraction is rounded to and the fraction of the total's uncertainty,
  in quadrature), and atmosphere 0.0142 plus or minus 0.0034 W m-2
  from the global atmospheric heat content gain of 7.25 plus or minus
  1.72 TW over the Earth's area; 0.0822 plus or minus 0.0174 W m-2
  together.[^vs-2023]

The residual is toa_net minus the sum of the three ocean-side terms;
the combined uncertainty is the four in quadrature (the anchor's
uncertainty inside the toa_net term); the verdict
`closed_within_uncertainty` is true when the residual lies within it.
The same four terms are stated as energy over the window (the rate
times the window length times the Earth's area, in zettajoules), and
the Argo receipt's own fitted and endpoint changes are copied beside
them with their shorter span, for the reader and not compared.

The bookkeeping table travels as the receipt's `bookkeeping` block,
and the attester refuses a receipt missing any of it: the anchoring
(the anchor value, its decade, the months the window shares with it,
and the statement that over those months the toa_net term is the in
situ estimate the product was set to), the weighting (the offset
between the cos-latitude and the geodetic mean over the window), the
edition (the product version, the release date, the DOI and the file
read), the uncertainty basis, the ocean input (the receipt's identity,
its domain and its area), the deep and non-ocean statements, the
published imbalance, the area convention and the window handling (a
month with no radiation value is a hole dropped from the mean and the
fit and never interpolated; whether the window is whole
years).[^gotcha-anchor][^data-root]

## The anomaly comparison, in which the anchor cancels

The adjustment that anchors EBAF is made once to the entire record, so
its interannual anomalies and its trend come from the radiometry, and
a comparison of their change with a change in the heat inventory is
the independent test the product supports.[^gotcha-anchor] The receipt
carries the cos-latitude global mean minus its own mean over the
months used (never the product's climatology, whose base period is
the anchor decade),[^gotcha-baseline] and the linear trend of that
anomaly over the window in W m-2 per decade: least squares on the
calendar epochs with the annual cycle removed as calendar-month group
means, the lag-1 autocorrelation over adjacent epochs, the effective
sample size capped at the sample, Student's t on the effective degrees
of freedom, and beside it the formal error the per-month floor
propagates; the term's uncertainty is the larger of the two. The
receipt states the distance of that trend from the published one, the
0.50 plus or minus 0.47 W m-2 per decade increase in the Earth's
energy imbalance from mid-2005 to mid-2019 that satellite and in situ
observations each yield.[^loeb-2021] The Argo receipt carries no
acceleration term, so the ocean side of this comparison is the
published in situ trend, not the receipt; the comparison is a
bookkeeping term and not the verdict.

## The fixture and its known truth

`--fixture --seed N` generates the record deterministically from a
hash-based Gaussian stream (no numeric library in the path, so the
digest cannot drift with a release): a monthly cos-latitude net flux
2000-03 through 2026-05 at a planted level of 0.95 W m-2 in July 2010
rising 0.50 W m-2 per decade, an annual cycle of 8.5 W m-2 peaking in
January, an interannual AR(1) component (0.8, 0.35 W m-2) and noise
at the stated 0.25 W m-2, a planted geodetic column offset by minus
0.218 W m-2 with a seasonal part, and a planted Argo-shaped receipt
whose rate is the noise-free geodetic window mean minus the deep and
non-ocean terms, so the budget closes by construction up to the noise
of the window mean. The receipt carries the seed, the fixture digest,
the generator's digest (the executor itself), the planted truth, and
a `known_truth` block with the planted window mean, trend and ocean
rate beside what was recovered; the attester regenerates the fixture
and compares every value.

## The refusal rule

A run writes a refusal receipt (`refused: true`, a `reason_code` and
the reason in words) and exits 3, never a number, when the window
lies outside the radiation record (`window-outside-record`); when the
Argo receipt's window is not the window asked for
(`ohc-window-mismatch`); when the Argo receipt is itself a refusal
(`ohc-receipt-refused`); when fewer than 24 months of the window carry
a value (`too-few-months`); or when the window mean's half width or
the anomaly trend's interval cannot be stated
(`interval-not-stated`). The attester attests a refusal PASS only as
a refusal, with the reason reproduced from the window and the
regenerated fixture or the tree it is given; its verdict line reads
`PASS refusal`.

## The attester criterion (deterministic, consumer-side)

A run PASSES only when all hold: every declared field present; the
code hash is the sanctioned file; the `bundle` block names this
package, version and release lock digest and the `capability` block is
well formed; a runtime is named; the fixture regenerated at the
receipt's seed hashes to the receipt's digest and so does the
generator (for a data root, the record, the files, the stamp and the
Argo receipt's identity are present, and with the tree given they
hash to the receipt's digests); the months used and missing partition
the window and the anomaly is the cos-latitude series minus its mean;
the window mean with its half width, the anomaly trend with its
interval and formal error, the four terms, the residual, the combined
uncertainty, the verdict, the energy over the window and the published
distances recompute from the receipt (1e-9 relative, with the
attester's own Student's t from the density); the bookkeeping is
complete, the anchor block is the sanctioned one and the shared months
are what the window gives; and stated plausibility bounds hold (the
toa_net term between minus 1 and 3 W m-2, the Argo rate between 0 and
2, the deep term between 0 and 0.2, the non-ocean term between 0 and
0.3, the anomaly trend within 3 W m-2 per decade of zero), with, on
the fixture, the recovered window mean within 0.3 W m-2 of the
planted one and the recovered trend within 1 W m-2 per decade of it.
The selftest covers a pass, nine tampers each failing on its check, a
wrong release, a tampered computation, two refusals and a forged one,
a synthetic data root verified against its tree, a fabricated tree,
the window mismatch refusal reproduced only against the tree, a
refused Argo receipt, and the attestation document.

## Reference run

W m-2 with an uncertainty of 0.2632 (sampling 0.2434, the anchor
0.10), against the planted geodetic window mean of 0.8799 (the
difference is the interannual component's contribution to a fifteen
year mean, inside the sampling half width); ohc_0_2000 +0.7377 with
0.0746 (the planted 11.8746 ZJ per year with the planted 1.2);
deep_ocean 0.06 with 0.03; non_ocean 0.0822 with 0.0174. Residual
+0.1649 against a bar of 0.2757; `closed_within_uncertainty` true.
Anomaly trend +0.1527 W m-2 per decade, 95 percent interval
[-0.4216, +0.7269], the planted 0.50 inside it. The refusal case the
chain exercises is the window 1998-01 through 2005-12 on the fixture:
exit 3 with `window-outside-record`, attested as a refusal. The
registry entry `energy-budget` in tools/reference_runs.yaml records
the arguments.

**Real-data run (the stamped data root energy-budget-root-2026-09-15,
2006-01 through 2020-12, measured 2026-09-15 under the runtime name
knowledge-seeder, run sha256:4c168f2bc0de10ea).** The radiation term was built by the loader
from the Edition 4.2.1 granule through 2026-05 read through the ASDC
OPeNDAP endpoint (the direct download host is unreachable from the
drafting environment, SOURCES.json says so), as 315 monthly global
means, every cell carrying a value; the ocean term is the Argo
receipt in the root.[^opendap-subset][^loaders][^data-root][^ohc-receipt]
180 of 180 months, 114 of them shared with the anchor decade.
toa_net +0.8746 W m-2 with an uncertainty of 0.1703 (sampling half
width 0.1378 at an effective sample of 87.6 months, the formal error
0.0801, the anchor 0.10); the cos-latitude window mean is 1.0921 and
the weighting offset 0.2176 (at most 0.2817 in a month). ohc_0_2000
+0.6005 with 0.0753 (the receipt's +9.6664 plus or minus 1.2118 ZJ per
year); deep_ocean 0.06 with 0.03; non_ocean 0.0822 with 0.0174; the
ocean side 0.7427 with 0.0829. Residual +0.1319 W m-2 against a bar
of 0.1894; `closed_within_uncertainty` true. As energy over the
fifteen years: toa_net 211.2 with 41.1 ZJ, the ocean side 179.3
(ocean 145.0 with 18.2, deep 14.5, non-ocean 19.9), residual 31.8
against a bar of 45.7; the Argo receipt's own fitted change is
+135.3 ZJ over its 14.0 year span. Anomaly trend +0.3706 W m-2 per
decade, 95 percent interval [+0.0762, +0.6649] (lag-1 autocorrelation
0.29, effective sample 98.0 of 180), 0.13 below the published 0.50
plus or minus 0.47, 0.28 of the published uncertainty.[^loeb-2021]

**The published anchor.** The Earth heat inventory states 0.76 plus
or minus 0.2 W m-2 for 2006 to 2020; the run's toa_net sits 0.11
above it and the run's ocean side 0.02 below it, both inside the
published uncertainty, the ocean side the closer because the
inventory's ocean is the same kind of estimate.[^vs-2023] The
toa_net term is not independent of the in situ estimate over the 114
shared months, which is the caveat the receipt states; the anomaly
trend is.[^gotcha-anchor] Observed on the file read and left for the
reviewer: the mean of the product's geodetic global net flux over the
anchor decade itself is 0.7387 W m-2, 0.03 above the 0.71 the
summaries name for the anchor.[^opendap-subset][^dqs]

**Pass bar.** There is no measured tolerance to record: the verdict
is a comparison of the residual against the uncertainty the receipt
itself carries, and the attester recomputes both. The plausibility
bounds are sanity bounds on the chain, not science tolerances.

## Boundaries

One real-data run exists, over 2006 through 2020, the window of the
Argo receipt the root carries; another window needs another Argo
receipt over exactly that window. The toa_net term carries the
product's anchor and its 0.10 W m-2 in situ uncertainty, and the
independent content of the absolute comparison is the radiometric
change between the anchor decade and the window; the anomaly trend is
the radiometric statement. The ocean term is over the Argo product's
mapped domain and understates the global ocean; the deep and
non-ocean terms are published rates over other periods (1992 to 2020,
2006 to 2020), not measurements over the window. The anomaly
comparison has no ocean-side acceleration from the receipt and is
made against the published in situ trend. The record was read through
the archive's OPeNDAP service as a subset; the loader also reads a
full product file from the ordering tool. Produced by Open Science
Pillars, not a NASA or CERES product.

**Verification.** The Edition 4.2 data quality summary and the
geodetic zone weights were read on 2026-09-15, and the weights applied
to the field read reproduce the product's own global mean to 2.4e-4
W m-2, which is the basis of the weighting statement
above;[^dqs][^geodetic-weights] the granule was read the same day
through the ASDC OPeNDAP endpoint after CMR listed it, and its hash is
in the data root's stamp;[^cmr-granules][^opendap-subset] the heat
inventory paper was read in full on the journal's site and every DOI
verified against the Crossref registry the same day (title, authors,
journal, year);[^vs-2023][^loeb-2018][^johnson-2016][^purkey-johnson-2010]
Loeb and others 2021 is cited on its registry record and abstract,
the journal page being behind a bot check;[^loeb-2021] the Argo
receipt was produced from the ocean-science plugin's committed data
root and attested there against the tree on 2026-09-15, and its
identity, hash and command are in SOURCES.json.[^ohc-receipt][^data-root]
The chain is verified on every change by the repository's check
routine, which runs the attester's selftest, the fixture run and its
